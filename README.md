### FAQ

* **Is this app built with Swift?**

Yes, Artify is built on top of Swift 4.1 and macOS Native library.

* **Why is 18th century art?**

Every time I have a short trip to an overseas country, I often spent 1 or 2 days to visit all famous art museum. I could stand for an hour to look at the detail, the scrape from those old oil photo. Individual traits could represent the history, the effort, the dream from original authors.

I realize I fall in love with the 18th art somehow 🤣

Then I come up with the idea, why don't we bring it to everybody, who has the same passion as me.

Let imagine, every day, when I open my laptop at 9 AM, I can see the best photo of this day, with detail information, history, and the author.
That would be amazing 😱

Without considering, I start to develop the macOS app as well as the [Artify-Core](https://github.com/NghiaTranUIT/artify-core), which is written by Golang.

All of the art pictures will be hand-picked by me and my best girlfriend. Hope you enjoy it 😍

* **Are you available for hire?**

Yes, I appreciate if you're looking for a newly dedicated teammate. Shot me an email if you'd to hire me.

* **How do I contact you?**
